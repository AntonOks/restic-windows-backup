# Changelog

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/tree/1.4.1) (2021-05-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/compare/1.4...1.4.1)

Bugfix release.

## Fixes
- Improved URL parsing so that the internet connectivity check works if the URL doesn't provide a protocol
- Add PowerShell 7.1 support to internet connectivity check

## Enhancements
- Setting $InternetTestAttempts to 0 will now bypass the internet connectivity checks entirely

## [1.4](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/tree/1.4) (2021-02-24)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/compare/1.3...1.4)

Moved to using Restic's inbuilt filesystem shadow copy creation (VSS).

## Breaking Change
`local.exclude` file changes that previously referenced the `resticVSS` directory will need to be changed to `C:\` or the relevant root drive letter.

## Other enhancements
- Future snapshot grouping (and cleanup) will be better since the root-level folders included in the backup won't change (instead, the script targets the root drive letter instead of a list of folders under the drive letter).
- Added the ability to set prune parameters via `.\config.ps1`, and defaulted the settings to `--group-by host` to clean up the aforementioned snapshot grouping & pruning.
- Updated the `windows.exclude` to include additional directories (most notably, the Recycle Bin is no longer backed up) 

**Closed issues:**

- Remove VSS Operations, Switch to `--use-fs-snapshot` [\#32](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/issues/32)
- powershell execution policy is blocking the scheduled task [\#27](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/issues/27)
- VSS Cleanup Upon Errors [\#8](https://github.com/kmwoley/restic-windows-backup/issues/8)
